## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

The best way to run a code in notebook is to upload it to Kaggle. If you want to run code locally you need: Python versions 3.* and nothing more than basic anaconda packages.

## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

This project aims to analyze posts posted on an online forum to predict the author's personality. To achieve that I wanted to answer three questions:

1. What is the distribution of each personality trait among forum users?
2. Are there any most significant word for every trait? Do extroverts write in a different way than introverts? Or maybe people with more sensitive approach are using emotional vocabulary?
3. Can personality type be predicted based on someones post?
